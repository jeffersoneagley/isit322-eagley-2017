# Comments Midterm Isit322 2017

This document contains Charlie's comments on your Isit322 2017 Midterm.

This is great.

Thanks for moving this out of the **Source** directory. I'm really not sure it was adding much and it was breaking my scripts.



## Basics

Your application has a styled menu and supports component switching. You included the following menu items:

- **Home**
- **GetFoo**
- **SmallNumbers**

## Additional Requests

- You made at least two more requests of the GitHub API
- You Included the results of these requests in the menu
- Your app switches between your Git request views

## Tests and Polish

- You have 180 tests in 6 test suites.
- JSCS is available and most major files in the project pass JSCS tests.
- Your code runs without warnings and errors.
- Polish.
- There is a bit of dead code in some files such as **routes/api.js**. Just delete it and depend on Git to get it back if needed, or else create a file called **deadcode.js** and put it there.

## Extra Credit

- Your **git-convert** program spits out field definition files. Very nice.
- You integrate **git-convert** into the code so it converts JSON to **field-definitions** automatically
